Lyrics for Song
<p>
    The club isn't the best place to find a lover
    So the bar is where I go (mmmm)
    Me and my friends at the table doing shots
    Drinking fast and then we talk slow (mmmm)
    And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
    And trust me I'll give it a chance now (mmmm)
    Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox
    And then we start to dance
    And now I'm singing like

    Girl, you know I want your love
    Your love was handmade for somebody like me
    Come on now, follow my lead
    I may be crazy, don't mind me
    Say, boy, let's not talk too much
    Grab on my waist and put that body on me
    Come on now, follow my lead
    Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

    I'm in love with the shape of you
    We push and pull like a magnet do
    Although my heart is falling too
    I'm in love with your body
    Last night you were in my room
    And now my bedsheets smell like you
    Every day discovering something brand new
    I'm in love with your body

    Oh I oh I oh I oh I
    I'm in love with your body
    Oh I oh I oh I oh I
    I'm in love with your body
    Oh I oh I oh I oh I
    I'm in love with your body
    Every day discovering something brand new
    I'm in love with the shape of you

    One week in we let the story begin
    We're going out on our first date (mmmm)
    You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
    Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate (mmmm)
    We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
    And how your family is doing okay (mmmm)
    And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
    Tell the driver make the radio play
    And I'm singing like

    Girl, you know I want your love
    Your love was handmade for somebody like me
    Come on now, follow my lead
    I may be crazy, don't mind me
    Say, boy, let's not talk too much
    Grab on my waist and put that body on me
    Come on now, follow my lead
    Come, come on now, follow my lead (mmmm)

    I'm in love with the shape of you
    We push and pull like a magnet do
    Although my heart is falling too
    I'm in love with your body
    Last night you were in my room
    And now my bedsheets smell like you
    Every day discovering something brand new
    I'm in love with your body

    Oh I oh I oh I oh I
    I'm in love with your body
    Oh I oh I oh I oh I
    I'm in love with your body
    Oh I oh I oh I oh I
    I'm in love with your body
    Every day discovering something brand new
    I'm in love with the shape of you

    Come on, be my baby, come on
    Come on, be my baby, come on
    Come on, be my baby, come on
    Come on, be my baby, come on
    Come on, be my baby, come on
    Come on, be my baby, come on
    Come on, be my baby, come on
    Come on, be my baby, come on

    I'm in love with the shape of you
    We push and pull like a magnet do
    Although my heart is falling too
    I'm in love with your body
    Last night you were in my room
    And now my bedsheets smell like you
    Every day discovering something brand new
    I'm in love with your body

    Come on, be my baby, come on
    Come on, be my baby, come on
    I'm in love with your body
    Come on, be my baby, come on
    Come on, be my baby, come on
    I'm in love with your body
    Come on, be my baby, come on
    Come on, be my baby, come on
    I'm in love with your body
    Every day discovering something brand new
    I'm in love with the shape of you
